https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-water-that-can-be-stored-between-two-buildings/

Given an integer array that represents the heights of N buildings. 
The task is to delete N â€“ 2 buildings such that the water that can be trapped between the remaining two buildings is maximum.
The total water trapped between two buildings is a gap between them (the number of buildings removed) multiplied by the height of the smaller building.


Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 4} 
Output: 1 

Input: arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5}
